GitHub Issue Tracker is used to track bug reports, feature requests and pull requests only. If your issue is a question or problem, please post it to [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/cettia).

Before opening a new issue, please check if the same issue already has been reported. For a complicated bug, please make sure to specify the followings. The less informations you provided, the lower priority it will get.

* Cettia version
* What you were trying to
* Expected output
* Bare minimum steps, code or working demo to reproduce
* Result with the latest version
* Result with an older version
* Anything where you think it's relevant

If you want to work on a complicated and time consuming work like introducing new feature as pull request, we need to discuss it first enough for you to avoid wasting too much time and to bring out the result we all want.
